# 🚨 BACKEND API ENDPOINT MISSING - CRITICAL ISSUE

**Date**: October 1, 2025  
**Status**: 🔴 **BLOCKING AI VIDEO PROCESSING**  
**Priority**: HIGH

---

## 📊 ISSUE SUMMARY

The Railway backend is deployed and healthy, but the **video upload endpoint is missing**.

### Current Status:

- ✅ Backend deployed: `https://web-production-7482d.up.railway.app`
- ✅ Health endpoint working: `/health` returns 200 OK
- ❌ Upload endpoint missing: `/api/v1/video/upload` returns 404 Not Found

---

## 🔍 ERROR DETAILS

### Console Output:

```
POST https://web-production-7482d.up.railway.app/api/v1/video/upload 404 (Not Found)

Error: Upload failed with status 404
```

### Health Check (Working):

```bash
curl https://web-production-7482d.up.railway.app/health
# Returns: {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"2025-10-01T...","service":"Dojo Backend - Video Processing API","version":"1.0.0","environment":"production"}
```

### Upload Endpoint (404):

```bash
curl https://web-production-7482d.up.railway.app/api/v1/video/upload
# Returns: {"detail":"Not Found"}
```

---

## 🎯 ROOT CAUSE

The backend deployment on Railway is **incomplete**. The health check endpoint is deployed, but the actual video processing API endpoints are not deployed or not configured correctly.

**Possible Causes:**

1. Backend code doesn't include the `/api/v1/video/upload` route
2. Backend was only partially deployed to Railway
3. Route configuration is incorrect
4. Backend is running but API routes not registered

---

## ✅ WHAT'S WORKING (Frontend Fixes Complete)

Our frontend fixes are all working correctly:

1. ✅ No hydration errors (nested button fixed)
2. ✅ Health check runs before upload
3. ✅ Detailed error logging (shows full error details, not `{}`)
4. ✅ Fixed JavaScript error: `aiSettings is not defined` → Changed to `aiProcessing.enabled`

---

## 🔧 REQUIRED FIXES

### Frontend Fix (COMPLETED ✅)

- Fixed `aiSettings is not defined` error
- Changed line 297 from `aiSettings.enabled` to `aiProcessing.enabled`

### Backend Fix (REQUIRED 🚨)

**Option 1: Deploy Complete Backend**
The Railway backend needs to have the following endpoints deployed:

- `POST /api/v1/video/upload` - Upload video for processing
- `GET /api/v1/video/status/:sessionId` - Check processing status
- `GET /api/v1/video/results/:sessionId` - Get processing results
- `POST /api/v1/video/cancel/:sessionId` - Cancel processing
- `DELETE /api/v1/video/cleanup/:sessionId` - Cleanup resources

**Option 2: Update Endpoint Path**
If the backend uses different endpoint paths, update the frontend:

```typescript
// In ai-video-processing.ts
// Change from:
`${this.backendUrl}/api/v1/video/upload`
// To whatever the actual path is, e.g.:
`${this.backendUrl}/upload`
// or
`${this.backendUrl}/process-video`;
```

## 📋 VERIFICATION STEPS

### Check Backend Deployment:

1. Access Railway dashboard
2. Check deployment logs for the backend service
3. Verify all routes are registered
4. Test endpoints manually with curl

### Verify Endpoints Exist:

```bash
# Test upload endpoint
curl -X POST https://web-production-7482d.up.railway.app/api/v1/video/upload

# Test status endpoint
curl https://web-production-7482d.up.railway.app/api/v1/video/status/test-id

# Test results endpoint
curl https://web-production-7482d.up.railway.app/api/v1/video/results/test-id
```

Expected: Should return something other than 404

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

For whoever deploys the backend:

- [ ] Verify backend code includes all API routes
- [ ] Check Railway environment variables are set
- [ ] Confirm CORS is configured for localhost:3000
- [ ] Deploy backend to Railway
- [ ] Test health endpoint: `/health`
- [ ] Test upload endpoint: `/api/v1/video/upload`
- [ ] Test status endpoint: `/api/v1/video/status/:id`
- [ ] Test results endpoint: `/api/v1/video/results/:id`
- [ ] Verify in browser that upload works
- [ ] Monitor Railway logs for errors

## 🔗 RELATED FILES

- **Frontend API Client**: `/src/lib/services/ai-video-processing.ts`
- **Backend URL Config**: `.env.local` → `NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_BACKEND_URL`
- **Railway Service**: `web-production-7482d.up.railway.app`

---

## 💡 TEMPORARY WORKAROUND

Until backend is deployed, AI video processing will fail with a clear error message:

```
"Upload failed with status 404"
```

Users will see this in the UI, and developers can check console logs for full details (thanks to our error logging improvements).

---

## 📊 IMPACT

**User Impact**:

- 🔴 **HIGH** - AI auto-segmentation feature completely blocked
- Users cannot upload videos for AI processing
- Manual video segmentation still works

**Developer Impact**:

- ✅ Error messages are clear and helpful
- ✅ Health check prevents wasted upload attempts
- ✅ Console logs show full debugging information

---

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

1. **Immediate**: Investigate Railway backend deployment
2. **Check**: Review backend code for API route definitions
3. **Deploy**: Push complete backend to Railway if missing
4. **Test**: Verify all endpoints return valid responses
5. **Monitor**: Check Railway logs for any deployment errors
